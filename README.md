# Reinforcement Learning: Lunar Lander
## Project Overview
This project is a basic exercise in demonstrating the use of artificial intelligence with neural networks and reinforcement learning to have a Player (the AI) learn how to play a simple 2D game, Lunar Lander, with the goal of landing a space-ship between two flags on a random terrain. The space-ship is capable of making very basic movements (do nothing, fire left engine, fire down engine, and fire right engine) in order to navigate to the goal.

The main technologies & libraries used in this project include:
- Python
- Visual Studio Code IDE
- [OpenAI's Gym API](https://github.com/openai/gym) - for the Lunar Lander game environment
- [Stable-Baselines3 Reinforcement Learning API](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3) - for streamlined reinforcement learning model implementation
- TensorBoard - for visual representations of model training

## Environment
What are we trying to solve? In this case we are attempting to solve the Lunar Lander game environment.

## Model 
What algorithm are we using? In this example, we will be using the PPO model.

## Agent
This is the virtual entity that is interacting with the environment using the model/algorithm.

## Observation ("State")
These are the important details of the environment that are fed to the model to make action predicitons. 

## Action 
What will the agent do after feeding an input observation (time-step).
Acitons can be "discreet" (clear classifications - go left or go right) or "continuous" (like regression, a range - go 0.02 right or 0.3261 up, etc).

## Step
A time-step in the environment. In general, each step in the environment will result in an agent action in that environment followed by a new observation and a "reward" for the action taken. 

## Reward
The agent receives a reward, either positive or negative, for its action in each step based on how it interacted with the environment and the resulting subsequent observation.
